# 🧑‍💻 Shiori Avino – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio, deployed at [shiori-avino.vercel.app](https://shiori-avino.vercel.app). This is a space where I share my journey from ESL teacher to full-stack developer. This site showcases the projects I've built, the skills I've cultivated, and the passion I bring to create applications.

## ✨ About Me

I began my career as an ESL teacher, a role I deeply cherished. When my visa status paused my career, a friend launched an educational project we’d been discussing — using his software engineering skills. Inspired, I dove into coding and quickly found joy in solving complex puzzles, building creative solutions, and crafting designs that reflected my vision. Though the journey has been challenging, with the support of engineer friends and incredible online resources, I’ve found real fulfillment in overcoming obstacles.
